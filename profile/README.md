## 2024 Hackathon

The 2024 Hackathon featured a range of challenges, including riddles in problem-solving (PS), machine learning (ML), computer vision (CV), and cybersecurity. Participants were tasked with building a machine learning model capable of classifying two voice fingerprints. Additionally, teams were required to integrate an API to interact with the game and retrieve their scores.
